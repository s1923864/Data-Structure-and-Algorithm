# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm

This course is an important foundation for all areas of Informatics.

It runs for the full year (10 credits in each semester), with approximately 15 lectures per semester. A mixture of tutorials and labs will be used to reinforce both mathematical and practical knowledge of algorithms and data structures, including differences between theoretical and empirical analysis.

Students' ability to implement and empirically analyse algorithms will be assessed via practical coursework, with an exam to assess other aspects of the course (knowledge and choice of existing algorithms and data structures, theoretical analysis, algorithmic strategies, and applications).

The following is an indicative list of topics covered:
Asymptotic notation and algorithmic analysis
Sequential data structures (lists, stacks, queues)
Basic and more advanced sorting algorithms
Tree data structures, heaps and priority queues
Hashing and dictionaries
Graphs and graph algorithms
Dynamic programming
The classes P and NP

Throughout, different specific algorithms and algorithmic strategies (such as divide-and-conquer, greedy, recursive backtracking, dynamic programming) will be introduced using real-world examples.
