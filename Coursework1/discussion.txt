The search only takes O(1) to get all lines of each key word. The reason is that this method advancedSearch search a word in a already built-in dictionary "MetaIndex.txt" and this dictionary
is an one-to-one dictionary.Hence,the total runtime is dependent on the next method we use, which is O(mn).Each time find the sentence contains keys need to compare the the hit of all 
keys to  find the the hit which is on all minRequired keys.suppose, each key has n hits in average and there are m minRequired keys in total,so the complixity is O(mn).
Its search time is quick, but it requires a large memory storage when we need to 
read many books. And each time the method advancedSearch  searches the words, it needs to read from an already built-in file "index.txt" . This means if the built-in
index file is very large, it also take a long time to read.Hence, this method is not very suitable to read a very large input.Furthermore,the efficiency will be very low, if
we always want to search the words from different books,because we need to build index file each time.
